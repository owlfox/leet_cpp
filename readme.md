# Introduction
This repository uses cmake to build and test my c++ solutions to leetcode.

At the moment I'm using vscode Microsoft cmake extension to build and run the tests.

Somehow this is also a repo with many of my c++ related code/learning material.. 
Bear with me I will clean this up..

## dependency catch2
```
mkdir build && cd build
conan install ..
cmake ..
make && make test
```

# TODO
